## About
I am a 5th year Ph.D. candidate at CESCA, Virginia Tech, advised by Prof. [Chao Wang](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~wang626/) since 2014 Fall. 
I am currently being a visiting student at University of Southern California, Department of Computer Science, also advised by Prof. Chao Wang. My research is to utilize formal methods and program analysis techniques to automatically improve program safety and security.
